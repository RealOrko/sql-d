## Current Multi-OS Support

At the moment due to restrictions on windows with file locking, this project does not support windows builds. You are better off building this in WSL on windows. 

There are assembly loading issues on MacOS for the native sqlite binaries using the current latest NuGet. 

Contributors more than welcome :)
