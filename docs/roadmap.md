### OAuth2

One of the things lacking is the ability to implement standard HTTP controls around security. This will be OAuth2 based with bearer tokens. 

### HTTPS

Encryption for transport protocols are severely lacking in this project. Will be adding this soon. 

### Containerisation

There is distinct lack of support for deploying this into container orchestration environments, containers will be added to releases soon. 

### Kubernetes

A helm chart for deploying this, with orchestration inside a cluster.
