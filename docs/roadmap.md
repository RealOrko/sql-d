### OAuth2

One of the things we are thinking about next is to implement standard HTTP controls around security. This will be OAuth2 based with bearer tokens which can be defined by editing the config using the SqlD UI. 

### HTTPS

Encryption for transport protocols are severely lacking in this project. Will be adding this soon. 

### Containerisation

There is distinct lack of support for deploying this into container orchestration environments, containers, helms charts et al.
